# Mixcloud Dashboard Clone

## The Brief

Cloning the main dashboard of a user signed in on Mixcloud.

Uses public Mixcloud API endpoint to display toast-style notification for users being followed going live. A maximum of three notifications is displayed at a time. When the oldest one at the top fades out or is closed manually, the next one is displayed at the bottom of the stack, until there are no new notifications left.

### Installation

Install the dependencies using npm. From the project's directory, run:

```
$ npm install
```

and then run the development environment:

```
$ npm start
```

A web server will be running at http://localhost:3000/
